            <p>JavaScript, was originally named Mocha, later it was renamed to LiveScript, and then to JavaScript.
              <br>
              <br>The language was then submitted for standarization to the ECMA International Organization. By that time, Netscape
              didn't allow the use of the "JavaScript" name, so the standarized language is named ECMAScript.

            <p>Now, Javascript is increasingly being used for maching learning and artificial intelligence as well. Usually
              when it comes to machine learning, R and Python is more popular but JS is fully capable of doing maching learning
              and AI and has many libraries built specifically for them. It's just that Javascript is not hyped up as much
              for machine learning as the other two.</p>
